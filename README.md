# Layout HTML-CSS

HTML5 semantics and CSS3 features as possible. Cross browser compatibility such as Chrome, Firefox Safari and Edge, latest versions.

# Requirements:

- [x] Use of media queries to adapt the layout in small screens. (comp not provided, so I use my creativity).
- [x] Non safe web font used: Lato
- [x] Preprocessors used SASS.
- [x] Clicking on one of the links of the main menu redirects the user to the other pages (only comp for the main page provided so just I use white pages with message on them).

# Interaction - JS

Just add interaction in the middle voting boxes: Kanye West, Mark Zuckerberg, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner and Malala Yousafzai.

# Requirements:

 - [x] Created a data feed in Firebase with the structure that best suits the content for the voting boxes and populated the initial content from it.
 - [x] The user can select either thumb up or thumb down button on each of the boxes (when the button is selected, a white border is displayed as featured in the comp)
 - [x] Once the user clicks on the "Vote now” button, a message is displayed saying “Thank you for voting!” as well as a vote again button to vote again.
 - [x] There is no limit in the amount of votes
 - [x] Percentage bars change depending on the up/or downs votes.
 - [x] Persist the current votes was a fact so if the page is refreshed the data is not lost. That's why I used Firebase non relational database
 - [x] Framework used React.
