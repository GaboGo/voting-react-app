# Layout HTML-CSS

HTML5 semantics and CSS3 features as possible. Cross browser compatibility such as Chrome, Firefox Safari and Edge, latest versions.

# Requirements:

 Use of media queries to adapt the layout in small screens. (comp not provided, so I use my creativity).
 Non safe web font used: Lato
 Preprocessors used SASS.
 Clicking on one of the links of the main menu redirects the user to the other pages (only comp for the main page provided so just I use white pages with message on them).

# Interaction - JS

Just add interaction in the middle voting boxes: Kanye West, Mark Zuckerberg, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner and Malala Yousafzai.

# Requirements:

 Created a data feed in Firebase with the structure that best suits the content for the voting boxes and populated the initial content from it.
 The user can select either thumb up or thumb down button on each of the boxes (when the button is selected, a white border is displayed as featured in the comp)
 Once the user clicks on the "Vote now” button, a message is displayed saying “Thank you for voting!” as well as a vote again button to vote again.
 There is no limit in the amount of votes
 Percentage bars change depending on the up/or downs votes.
 Persist the current votes was a fact so if the page is refreshed the data is not lost. That's why I used Firebase non relational database
 Framework used React.
